The problem is that while the first table holds one row for each player, the key in the second table is player+season, so if we do a regular join, the result would be a cartesian product, and each player's basic details would appear as many times as this player appears in the attributes table. The result would be that the average would be skewed towards players that appear many times in the attribute table.\n","\n","The solution, is to use a subquery.  We would need to group the attributes table, to a different key - player level only (without season). Of course we would need to decide first how we would want to combine all the attributes to a single row. I used average, but one can also decide on maximum, latest season and etc.\n","Once both tables have the same keys, we can join them together (think of the subquery as any other table, only temporal), knowing that we won't have duplicated rows after the join.\n","\n","In addition, you can see here two examples of how to use functions:\n","* Conditional function is an important tool for data manipulation. While IF statement is very popular in other languages, SQLite is not supporting it, and it's implemented using CASE + WHEN + ELSE statement.\n","As you can see, based on the input of the data, the query would return different results.\n","\n","* ROUND - straight sorward.\n","Every SQL languages comes with a lot of usefull functions by default."],"metadata":{"_uuid":"fd444f1cf990ec5cc42c889a65cabff0f1353d27","_cell_guid":"f17cbfb9-d25c-4597-887a-6114eddda250","id":"pWXLDv55pL4D"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["players_height = pd.read_sql(\"\"\"SELECT CASE\n","                                        WHEN ROUND(height)<165 then 165\n","                                        WHEN ROUND(height)>195 then 195\n","                                        ELSE ROUND(height)\n","                                        END AS calc_height,\n","                                        COUNT(height) AS distribution,\n","                                        (avg(PA_Grouped.avg_overall_rating)) AS avg_overall_rating,\n","                                        (avg(PA_Grouped.avg_potential)) AS avg_potential,\n","                                        AVG(weight) AS avg_weight\n","                            FROM PLAYER\n","                            LEFT JOIN (SELECT Player_Attributes.player_api_id,\n","                                        avg(Player_Attributes.overall_rating) AS avg_overall_rating,\n","                                        avg(Player_Attributes.potential) AS avg_potential\n","                                        FROM Player_Attributes\n","                                        GROUP BY Player_Attributes.player_api_id)\n","                                        AS PA_Grouped ON PLAYER.player_api_id = PA_Grouped.player_api_id\n","                            GROUP BY calc_height\n","                            ORDER BY calc_height\n","                                ;\"\"\", conn)\n","players_height"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"c0620891169bb5ea3d0de4f800737f40a93c6b03","_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":false,"_cell_guid":"cda7c6ea-33af-4155-a2fa-93548aef12e7","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-21T19:35:13.308156Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-21T19:35:13.308462Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-21T19:35:13.834243Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-21T19:35:13.30841Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-21T19:35:13.833473Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"EFHbAxPfpL4D"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["players_height.plot(x=['calc_height'],y=['avg_overall_rating'],figsize=(12,5),title='Potential vs Height')"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"391bd233403a29cc9be121f12afcaeae83a20952","_kg_hide-input":true,"_cell_guid":"3c06ab2d-d93c-4cf0-a8b8-55df5753e24f","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-21T19:38:56.680794Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-21T19:38:56.681072Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-21T19:38:56.840342Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-21T19:38:56.681038Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-21T19:38:56.839549Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"FCzzpsJPpL4D"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
